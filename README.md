# Scalable Pipelined Lookup (FPGA)

Dual-parallel fixed-latency lookup (CAM-like) of IP address prefixes.

This uses state-of-the-art research (2022) on a novel tree structure; 30% more efficient than existing solutions.

Available in SystemVerilog and a subsequent SpinalHDL rewrite.

Re-usable in router and switch applications.
